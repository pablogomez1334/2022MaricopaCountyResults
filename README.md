# 2022MaricopaCountyResults

The analysis focuses on the 2022 Midterm results in Maricopa County, which is considered one of the most consequential counties in the United States due to its influence on Arizona statewide elections. The analysis aims to investigate and research various narratives or commonly held beliefs about elections, including turnout during Midterms, split-ticket voting, and the impact of third-party candidacies, particularly Libertarian Party candidates, on Republican candidacy results.

Based on the literature review, the analysis finds that historically, Midterm election turnout has been significantly lower than Presidential election turnout, and there is a belief that higher turnout benefits the Democratic Party. However, research suggests that non-voters are not necessarily more likely to vote for Democrats, but may instead jump on the bandwagon of the perceived winning candidate.

In an increasingly partisan environment, split-ticket voting has decreased as voters tend to vote straight party line. Split-ticket voting was previously used to bring about policy/ideological balance in governing institutions or to assess individual candidates.

Third-party candidacies, particularly Libertarian Party candidates, have had significant effects on Republican candidacy results. Research suggests that Republicans would gain a 2-1 majority over Democrats if Libertarians had to choose between the two parties, and that Libertarian spoilers may have contributed to Trump's loss in states like Arizona and Georgia.

Data for the analysis was collected from the publicly available results of Maricopa County Elections Department website, which includes variables such as contest name, precinct name, precinct registered, precinct turnout, candidate name, and votes received.

The analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the literature review and data collection methods, setting the stage for further analysis of the 2022 Midterm results in Maricopa County.
